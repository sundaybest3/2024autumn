2. The Needs of Quality Education
   - Multimedia English language teaching can enable students to be involved in a variety of sensory organ in the learning process and stimulate the students in the corresponding cortical function area.
   - This stimulation is favor of understanding and memorizing knowledge, produces better learning outcomes, and improves classroom efficiency.
  
3. The Needs of Students' Cognitive Mental
   - The visual organs are the most important informed organs of human (WANG, 1992).
   - Only the multimedia teaching system can fully mobilize the students' audio-visual and other sensory organs, thus getting the best of the cognitive effect.
